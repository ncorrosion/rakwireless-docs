### Connecting to Helium  (The People's Network) 

Helium has quickly become the most widespread LPWAN communal network with more than 27,000 devices deployed globally. All our node products are compatible with it and the process of adding a device to the network is intuitive and straightforward. 

This section will focus on giving a brief guide on how to connect the RAK7201 to the network console, assuming that there is a Helium Hotspot within range.

Log in or create your account [here](https://www.helium.com/console):

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7201/quickstart/connecting-to-helium/1.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Helium console"
/>

Once registered/logged in you will end up at the home page where you can see your function tree on the left and your DC balance at the tops as well as a number of useful links.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7201/quickstart/connecting-to-helium/2.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Helium console home screen"
/>

Go to the **Devices** section in the function tree. If this is your first time doing this there will be no devices registered. Click the **+ Add Device** button to get started

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7201/quickstart/connecting-to-helium/3.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Helium devices"
/>

A window will pop up with a set of field containing the device parameters required for its registration.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7201/quickstart/connecting-to-helium/4.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Add a new device"
/>

Fill in a name of your choosing. The **Dev EUI**, **App EUI**, and **App Key** will have random values generated for you by default. Press the eye icon to reveal the values. You can manually replace them with values of your own. For this tutorial, use the default values. Press the **Submit** button, and you are done.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7201/quickstart/connecting-to-helium/5.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="Helium devices"
/>

Now, your RAK7201 is registered and is awaiting activation. For this to happen we need to import the Dev EUI, App EUI and App Key in the RAK7201 using the [RAK Serial Port Tool](https://downloads.rakwireless.com/en/LoRa/Tools/RAK_SERIAL_PORT_TOOL_V1.2.1.zip).

Open the tool, select the desired port (default baud rate) and open it. Hold Button 1 for 3 seconds to enter configuration mode and start importing your settings.

Configure your LoRa band and activation mode. This tutorial will be using the EU868 band and OTAA (only option available for now with Helium) with device class A (default one, does not need configuring).

- Regional band, device class and activation mode setting

```
at+set_config=lora:join_mode:0
```

```
at+set_config=lora:region:EU868
```


- Enter the Dev UI

Use the command below by replacing the XXXX with your Device EUI from the Helium console:

```
at+set_config=lora:dev_eui:XXXX
```

- Enter the App EUI

Same as with the Device EUI, replace the XXXX with your value:

```
at+set_config=lora:app_eui:XXXX
```

- Enter App Key

Finally fill in the App key with the command:

```
at+set_config=lora:app_key:XXXX
```

- Join Network

Finish executing the join command in order for the node to initiate the join procedure. Once the procedure is initiated and successfully complete you will have a notification in the serial console

```
at+join
```

You output should resemble the one in Figure 12:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wisnode/rak7201/quickstart/connecting-to-helium/7.png"
  width="80%"
  caption="RAK7201 EUIs and key"
/>

If you take a look at the Helium console, you will also see the join request packets both in the graph and event log. Your node is now a part of the Helium Network.

## HeartBeat function

The HeartBeat is used to monitor the network connection and to send the battery level information of the WisNode Button 4K. 

The device can send a HeartBeat packet according to the configured HeartBeat interval. The AT command for configuring the HeartBeat interval is:

```
at+heartbeat=<interval>
```

 Where the interval range is 0-120 (in hours), 0 to turn off the function.

Example:

Set the HeartBeat to one hour using the command:

```
at+heartbeat=1
```

The HeartBeat message data format is:


| Headers | Payload              |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| 0X48    | Battery level in HEX |

The battery level is represented in percentage form in hexadecimal format.

For example: if the payload message of the HeartBeat is 48 60, this represents 96% battery level.

The device will automatically send a low-voltage alarm signal when the battery power is below 20% and again when it is below 10%.
Battery power warning signal:


| Battery power          | Warning signal |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| Power is less than 20% | 57 14          |
| Power is less than 10% | 57 0a          |

## Device Restart

Two restart options are available:

1. You can restart the device by using the AT command:

```
at+set_config=device:restart
```

/>

2. You can restart the device by holding Key 2 for three seconds. When held, the blue LED will stay lit, and will turn off when the device is restarted. 

::: tip 📝 NOTE:
After the device restart manually or by AT command the WisNode Button 4K will try to join the network automatically if the OTAA method is configured. This will be indicated by 4 blue LEDs flashing clockwise. The device will make three attempts to Join the Network. If a Join attempt fails, the red LED on button 4 will flash for 1 second. If the three join attempts are failed, the device needs to be restarted manually or by AT command to make a new attempt.
